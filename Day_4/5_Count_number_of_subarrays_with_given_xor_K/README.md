# Problem 5 of Day 4: Count number of subarrays with given xor K

## Problem Statement

The problem involves finding the total number of subarrays within an integer array where the bitwise XOR (exclusive or) of all elements in the subarray is equal to a given integer `k`.

## Time Complexity

O(n^2)

## Space Complexity

O(1)

## Code Explanation

The code solves the problem with the following approach:

1. It starts by initializing the answer variable `ans` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the count of subarrays with XOR equal to `k`.

2. The code then iterates through the elements of the input array `nums`. The outer loop (first loop) runs from index `i` equal to 0 to the end of the array.

3. Inside the outer loop, there is an inner loop (second loop) that runs from index `j` equal to `i` to the end of the array. This nested loop considers all possible subarrays starting from index `i`.

4. Within the inner loop, a variable `xr` (short for XOR) is initialized to 0. It represents the cumulative XOR of elements in the current subarray being considered.

5. As the inner loop iterates through the elements in the subarray, it continuously updates the `xr` by XORing it with the current element `nums[j]`. This operation mimics the XOR of all elements in the subarray.

6. After each XOR operation, the code checks if the `xr` is equal to the target value `k`. If the XOR of the current subarray is equal to `k`, it means a valid subarray is found, and the `ans` counter is incremented by 1.

7. The inner loop continues to explore all possible subarrays within the current outer loop iteration.

8. The outer loop then moves on to the next index, and the inner loop explores subarrays starting from that index.

9. The entire process repeats for all possible subarrays in the array.

10. The final value of `ans` represents the count of subarrays with XOR equal to the target `k`.

11. In the `main` function, an example array `a` and a target XOR value `k` are defined, and the `subarraysWithXorK` function is called to find and print the number of subarrays with XOR equal to `k`.

The code efficiently counts the number of subarrays with a given XOR value using nested loops to explore all possible subarrays. However, it has a time complexity of O(n^2), which may not be optimal for large input arrays. There are more efficient algorithms, like using a hashmap, to achieve O(n) time complexity for this problem.
